The Files API allows you to upload and manage files to use with the Claude API without having to re-upload content with each request. For more information about the Files API, see the [developer guide for files](/en/docs/build-with-claude/files).

The Files API is currently in beta. To use the Files API, youâ€™ll need to include the beta feature header: `anthropic-beta: files-api-2025-04-14`.Please reach out through our [feedback form](https://forms.gle/tisHyierGwgN4DUE9) to share your experience with the Files API.

#### Headers

To use multiple betas, use a comma separated list like `beta1,beta2` or specify the header multiple times for each beta.
