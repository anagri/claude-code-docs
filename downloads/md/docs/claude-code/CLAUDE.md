### **bedrock-vertex-proxies.md**
Overview and comparison of deployment options for Claude Code including Anthropic API, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Vertex AI. Explains the distinction between corporate proxies (HTTP/HTTPS routing) and LLM gateways (authentication and provider endpoints). Provides configuration examples for combining providers with proxies or gateways, choosing deployment strategies, and best practices for enterprise adoption including CLAUDE.md documentation, security policies, and MCP integration.

### **checkpointing.md**
Automatic tracking system that captures code state before each edit, enabling quick undo and rewind to previous states. Checkpoints persist across sessions for 30 days (configurable) and support rewinding conversation only, code only, or both. Access via double-Esc or `/rewind` command. Limitations include no tracking of bash command changes, external edits, or replacement for version control systems like Git.

### **cli-reference.md**
Complete command-line interface reference covering all CLI commands and flags. Commands include starting sessions, continuing conversations, resuming by ID, and updates. Flags enable directory access control, custom subagents, permission management, output formats (text/json/stream-json), model selection, and non-interactive operation. Detailed agents flag format for defining custom subagents with tools, models, and prompts.

### **common-workflows.md**
Comprehensive collection of practical workflows including: understanding codebases (overview, finding code, execution flow), fixing bugs, refactoring, using specialized subagents, Plan Mode for safe analysis, working with tests, creating pull requests, handling documentation, working with images, referencing files with @, using extended thinking, resuming conversations, running parallel sessions with Git worktrees, using Claude as a unix-style utility (piping, output formats), and creating custom slash commands with $ARGUMENTS placeholders.

### **costs.md**
Cost tracking and management guidance. Average cost is $6/developer/day with 90% of users under $12/day. Team usage typically $100-200/developer/month. Provides `/cost` command for session statistics, historical usage tracking via Claude Console, workspace spend limits, and rate limit recommendations based on organization size (1-500+ users with specific TPM/RPM per-user targets). Cost reduction strategies include conversation compaction, specific queries, breaking down tasks, and clearing history. Explains background token usage for summarization and command processing.

### **data-usage.md**
Data policies, retention, and flow documentation. Consumer users (Free/Pro/Max) can opt-in to model training with 5-year retention; those who opt-out have 30-day retention. Commercial users (Team/Enterprise/API) have standard 30-day retention with optional zero data retention. Data flows through NPM, runs locally, and connects to Anthropic APIs with TLS encryption. Telemetry services include Statsig (metrics), Sentry (error logging), and optional bug reporting. Default behaviors differ by API provider (Claude API, Vertex, Bedrock) with non-essential traffic disabled by default for cloud providers.

### **devcontainer.md**
Reference development container implementation providing production-ready Node.js environment with security-focused design. Features include custom firewall restricting network access to whitelisted domains, developer-friendly tools (git, ZSH, fzf), VS Code integration with pre-configured extensions, session persistence, and cross-platform compatibility (macOS/Windows/Linux). Security includes precise access control (npm registry, GitHub, Claude API), allowed DNS/SSH, default-deny policy, and startup verification. The isolated environment enables safe operation with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag. Available on GitHub as reference implementation.

### **github-actions.md**
Comprehensive guide for Claude Code GitHub Actions integration built on the Claude Code SDK. Enables PR creation, automated code implementation, and bug fixes via `@claude` mentions. Setup options include quick setup via `/install-github-app` or manual setup with GitHub app installation and workflow file creation. Upgrading from beta requires version update, removing mode configuration, and migrating inputs. Example use cases cover basic workflows, slash commands, custom automation with prompts, and common tasks. Best practices include CLAUDE.md configuration, security considerations (never commit API keys), performance optimization, and cost awareness (GitHub Actions minutes + API tokens). Supports AWS Bedrock and Google Vertex AI with custom GitHub apps and OIDC authentication.

### **gitlab-ci-cd.md**
Claude Code for GitLab CI/CD integration (currently in beta) built on the Claude Code CLI and SDK. Enables instant MR creation, automated implementation from issues, project-aware changes following CLAUDE.md guidelines, and simple setup with one job in `.gitlab-ci.yml` plus a masked CI/CD variable. Works with Claude API, AWS Bedrock (via OIDC), or Google Vertex AI (via Workload Identity Federation). Example configurations provided for all three providers with authentication setup, job definitions, and security best practices. Supports event-driven orchestration with `@claude` mentions in issues/MRs, provider abstraction for flexible deployment, and sandboxed execution with workspace-scoped permissions. Cost optimization tips included.

### **google-vertex-ai.md**
Configuration guide for Claude Code with Google Vertex AI. Prerequisites include GCP account with billing, Vertex AI API enabled, access to Claude models, gcloud CLI, and quota allocation. Supports both global and regional endpoints with region configuration guidance. Setup covers enabling Vertex AI API, requesting model access, configuring GCP credentials, setting environment variables (CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX, CLOUD_ML_REGION, ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_PROJECT_ID), and model configuration. IAM requires aiplatform.user role or custom role with specific permissions. Supports 1M token context window (beta) and includes troubleshooting for quota issues, model not found errors, and 429 errors.

### **headless.md**
Non-interactive programmatic usage via `--print` (-p) flag for scripts and automation. Configuration options include output formats (text/json/stream-json), input formats (text/stream-json for multi-turn conversations), and key flags for allowed/disallowed tools, MCP config, session resumption, and permission prompts. Multi-turn conversations support resuming by session ID or continuing most recent conversation. Example use cases include SRE incident response bot, automated security review, and multi-turn legal assistant. Best practices cover JSON output parsing with jq, graceful error handling, session management, timeouts, and rate limit respect.

### **hooks-guide.md**
User-defined shell commands executing at various lifecycle points (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, UserPromptSubmit, Notification, Stop, SubagentStop, PreCompact, SessionStart, SessionEnd). Enables deterministic control for notifications, automatic formatting, logging, feedback, and custom permissions. Quickstart covers logging bash commands with jq. Examples include code formatting (prettier/gofmt), markdown formatting with language detection, custom notifications (notify-send), and file protection (blocking edits to .env files). Security disclaimer emphasizes user responsibility for hook commands. See hooks.md for complete reference documentation.

### **hooks.md**
Complete reference documentation for Claude Code hooks. Configuration structure uses settings.json with matchers and hook arrays. Hook events include PreToolUse (runs before tools, can block), PostToolUse (runs after completion), Notification, UserPromptSubmit, Stop, SubagentStop, PreCompact, SessionStart, and SessionEnd. Hook input/output schemas detailed for each event type with JSON format. Supports exit code 0 (success), exit code 2 (blocking with stderr feedback to Claude), and advanced JSON output for sophisticated control (permissionDecision, additionalContext, continue/stopReason). MCP tool naming pattern (mcp__server__tool) supported. Security considerations include validation, quoting, path traversal blocking, absolute paths, and skipping sensitive files. Debugging tips and execution details provided.

### **iam.md**
Identity and Access Management covering authentication methods (Claude API via Console, Amazon Bedrock, Google Vertex AI), access control, and permissions. Permission system includes tiered approval (read-only no approval, bash commands require approval, file modifications require approval) with configurable rules (allow/ask/deny) and tool-specific patterns. Permission modes include default, acceptEdits, plan, and bypassPermissions. Working directories can be extended via CLI, session commands, or settings. Tool-specific permission rules detailed for Bash (prefix matching with limitations), Read/Edit (gitignore specification with path types), WebFetch (domain matching), and MCP (server and tool matching without wildcards). Enterprise managed policy settings enforce organizational security. Credential management covers storage location (macOS Keychain), supported types, and custom credential scripts with refresh intervals.

### **ide-integrations.md**
VS Code extension (beta) provides native IDE experience with dedicated sidebar panel, plan mode with editing, auto-accept edits mode, file management, MCP server usage, conversation history, multiple sessions, keyboard shortcuts, and slash commands. Requires VS Code 1.98.0+. Supports third-party providers (Bedrock/Vertex) via environment variables configuration. Not yet implemented features include full MCP server configuration, subagents configuration, checkpoints, advanced shortcuts (#, !), and tab completion. Security considerations warn about IDE configuration file modification risks with auto-edit permissions. Legacy CLI integration provides selection context sharing, diff viewing, file reference shortcuts, and automatic diagnostic sharing for VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and VSCodium.

### **interactive-mode.md**
Keyboard shortcuts and input methods for interactive sessions. General controls include Ctrl+C (cancel), Ctrl+D (exit), Ctrl+L (clear screen), Ctrl+R (reverse search), Up/Down arrows (history), Esc+Esc (rewind), Tab (toggle thinking), Shift+Tab (toggle permission modes). Multiline input supports quick escape (\\+Enter), macOS default (Option+Enter), terminal setup (Shift+Enter via /terminal-setup), Ctrl+J, and paste mode. Quick commands use # (memory shortcut), / (slash commands), ! (bash mode). Vim editor mode with mode switching, navigation, and editing commands. Command history with reverse search (Ctrl+R) for interactive searching. Background bash commands with Ctrl+B for backgrounding and ! prefix for bash mode.

### **jetbrains.md**

ESC key configuration may be needed for interrupting Claude operations. Special configurations for remote development (install on remote host) and WSL (additional networking/firewall setup). Security considerations same as VS Code integration.

### **legal-and-compliance.md**
Legal agreements covering Commercial Terms (Team/Enterprise/API users) and Consumer Terms (Free/Pro/Max users). Commercial agreements apply whether using Claude API directly (1P) or through AWS Bedrock/Google Vertex (3P). Healthcare compliance (BAA) automatically extends to Claude Code for customers with executed BAA and Zero Data Retention (ZDR) activated. Security and trust information available at Anthropic Trust Center and Transparency Hub. Security vulnerability reporting via HackerOne.

### **llm-gateway.md**
LLM gateway configuration for centralized proxy layer providing centralized authentication, usage tracking, cost controls, audit logging, and model routing. Focuses on LiteLLM configuration (third-party, unaffiliated with Anthropic). Authentication methods include static API key (ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN) and dynamic API key with helper script (apiKeyHelper with TTL refresh). Endpoint options include unified endpoint (recommended for load balancing/fallbacks) and provider-specific pass-through endpoints (Claude API, Amazon Bedrock, Google Vertex AI). Model selection via environment variables. Disclaimer emphasizes Anthropic doesn't endorse/maintain/audit LiteLLM security.

### **mcp.md**
Comprehensive Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration guide. MCP servers give Claude Code access to external tools, databases, and APIs. Popular servers organized by category: Development/Testing (Sentry, Socket, Hugging Face, Jam), Project Management (Asana, Atlassian, ClickUp, Intercom, Linear, Notion, Box, Fireflies, Monday), Databases (Airtable, Daloopa, HubSpot), Payments (PayPal, Plaid, Square, Stripe), Design/Media (Figma, Cloudinary, invideo, Canva), Infrastructure/DevOps (Cloudflare, Netlify, Stytch, Vercel), and Automation (Workato, Zapier). Installation supports three transport types: stdio (local processes), SSE (server-sent events for streaming), HTTP (request/response). MCP installation scopes include local (default, project-specific user settings), project (.mcp.json in repo), and user (cross-project). Environment variable expansion supported in .mcp.json. OAuth 2.0 authentication via /mcp command. Features include MCP resources (@ mentions), MCP prompts as slash commands, and enterprise MCP configuration with managed servers. MCP output limits (10K token warning, 25K default max, configurable via MAX_MCP_OUTPUT_TOKENS).

### **memory.md**
Memory system using CLAUDE.md files at four hierarchical levels: Enterprise policy (organization-wide IT/DevOps managed), Project memory (./CLAUDE.md or ./.claude/CLAUDE.md for team-shared), User memory (~/.claude/CLAUDE.md for personal cross-project), and Project memory local (./CLAUDE.local.md for personal project-specific, now deprecated in favor of imports). CLAUDE.md imports support @path/to/import syntax with both relative and absolute paths, including home directory files. Imports not evaluated in code spans/blocks, max depth 5 hops. Claude recursively reads CLAUDE.md files up directory tree from cwd (excluding root) and discovers CLAUDE.md in subtrees when reading files. Quick add via # shortcut, direct edit via /memory command. Project memory bootstrap via /init command. Organization-level memory deployment via enterprise CLAUDE.md file. Best practices include specificity, structured organization with markdown headings, and periodic review.

### **model-config.md**
Model configuration covering available models and aliases. Model aliases include default (recommended per account type), sonnet (latest Sonnet 4.5), opus (Opus 4.1), haiku (fast efficient), sonnet[1m] (1M token context), and opusplan (opus in plan mode, sonnet in execution). Setting methods in priority order: during session (/model command), at startup (--model flag), environment variable (ANTHROPIC_MODEL), or settings file (model field). Special behaviors include default model auto-fallback for Max users and opusplan automatic model switching. Extended context [1m] suffix for Console/API users with different pricing. Environment variables control model aliases: ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL, ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL, ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL, and CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL.

### **monitoring-usage.md**
OpenTelemetry (OTel) metrics and events for monitoring (currently in beta). Quick start configuration via environment variables: CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TELEMETRY, OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER (otlp/prometheus/console), OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER (otlp/console), OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL (grpc/http/json/http/protobuf), endpoints, headers, and export intervals. Administrator configuration via managed-settings.json. Configuration variables include common settings, metrics cardinality control (session ID, version, account UUID), dynamic headers via otelHeadersHelper script (limitations: fetched only at startup), multi-team organization support via OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES (strict W3C Baggage spec formatting). Available metrics include session count, lines of code count (added/removed), pull request count, commit count, cost usage (USD), token usage (input/output/cacheRead/cacheCreation), code edit tool decision (accept/reject by tool/language), and active time. Events include user prompt, tool result (with decision/source), API request, API error, and tool decision. Service information includes resource attributes (service name, version, OS, host arch, WSL version). ROI measurement guide available on GitHub. Security/privacy considerations emphasize opt-in, no sensitive data, and prompt content redaction (enable via OTEL_LOG_USER_PROMPTS=1). Monitoring implementation guide for Amazon Bedrock available.

### **network-config.md**
Enterprise network and security configurations via environment variables (also configurable in settings.json). Proxy configuration supports standard variables (HTTPS_PROXY, HTTP_PROXY, NO_PROXY) with basic authentication (username:password in URL). Custom CA certificates via NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS for HTTPS connections. mTLS authentication via CLAUDE_CODE_CLIENT_CERT, CLAUDE_CODE_CLIENT_KEY, and optional CLAUDE_CODE_CLIENT_KEY_PASSPHRASE. Network access requirements include api.anthropic.com, claude.ai, statsig.anthropic.com, and sentry.io. Important for proxy/firewall allowlisting in containerized or restricted environments.

### **output-styles.md**
Output styles modify Claude Code's system prompt to change agent behavior. Built-in styles include Default (existing software engineering system prompt), Explanatory (educational insights while coding), and Learning (collaborative learn-by-doing with TODO(human) markers). Output styles directly modify system prompt by excluding default code generation instructions and adding custom instructions. Change via /output-style command (menu or direct switch). Custom output styles via /output-style:new or markdown files in ~/.claude/output-styles (user level) or .claude/output-styles (project level). Markdown structure includes YAML frontmatter (name, description) and custom system prompt. Comparisons clarify differences from CLAUDE.md (user message vs system prompt modification), subagents (main loop vs task-specific), and custom slash commands (stored system prompts vs stored prompts).

### **overview.md**
Quick 30-second installation guide (Node.js 18+, npm install, navigate to project, run claude). Claude Code builds features from descriptions, debugs and fixes issues, navigates any codebase (with MCP for external datasources), and automates tedious tasks. Why developers love it: works in terminal (not another IDE), takes action (edit files, run commands, create commits), Unix philosophy (composable/scriptable), and enterprise-ready (Claude API or AWS/GCP hosting with security/privacy/compliance). VS Code Extension (Beta) mentioned for graphical interface preference. Next steps include Quickstart, Common workflows, Troubleshooting, and IDE setup. Additional resources cover AWS/GCP hosting, Settings, Commands, Reference implementation (devcontainer), Security, and Privacy/data usage.

### **quickstart.md**
5-minute getting started guide covering installation (npm or native install for macOS/Linux/WSL/Windows), login (Claude.ai recommended or Claude Console), starting first session, asking questions (codebase overview, Claude capabilities), making first code change with approval process, using Git conversationally, fixing bugs or adding features, and testing common workflows (refactor, write tests, update docs, code review). Essential commands table includes interactive mode, one-time tasks, one-off queries, continuing conversations, resuming previous conversations, Git commits, clearing history, help, and exit. Pro tips for beginners emphasize specificity, step-by-step instructions, letting Claude explore first, and using shortcuts (Tab completion, up arrow history, / for slash commands). Next steps include Common workflows, CLI reference, and Configuration.

### **sdk.md**
Migration guide for Claude Code SDK rebranding to Claude Agent SDK. Package names changed: @anthropic-ai/claude-code → @anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk (TS/JS), claude-code-sdk → claude-agent-sdk (Python). Documentation moved from Claude Code docs to API Guide → Agent SDK section. Migration steps for TypeScript/JavaScript: uninstall old package, install new package, update imports, update package.json dependencies. Migration steps for Python: uninstall old package, install new package, update imports from claude_code_sdk to claude_agent_sdk, rename ClaudeCodeOptions to ClaudeAgentOptions, review breaking changes. Breaking changes in v0.1.0: Python type rename (ClaudeCodeOptions → ClaudeAgentOptions), system prompt no longer default (must explicitly request claude_code preset), settings sources not loaded by default (must specify settingSources: ['user', 'project', 'local'] for previous behavior). Rationale emphasizes better isolation and explicit configuration for SDK applications, important for CI/CD, deployed applications, testing, and multi-tenant systems.

### **security.md**
Security foundation based on Anthropic's comprehensive security program (SOC 2 Type 2, ISO 27001, available at Trust Center). Permission-based architecture with strict read-only defaults and explicit approval for file edits, tests, and commands. Built-in protections include write access restriction to working directory and subfolders, prompt fatigue mitigation via allowlisting, and Accept Edits mode for batch approval. User responsibility for reviewing proposed code/commands. Prompt injection protections include permission system, context-aware analysis, input sanitization, command blocklist (curl/wget by default), privacy safeguards (limited retention, restricted access, user data training control), additional safeguards (network request approval, isolated context windows, trust verification, command injection detection, fail-closed matching, natural language descriptions, secure credential storage). Best practices for untrusted content: review commands, avoid piping untrusted content, verify critical file changes, use VMs for scripts/tool calls with external services, report suspicious behavior via /bug. MCP security emphasizes user configuration and trust. IDE security references. Team security via enterprise managed policies, version control sharing, training, and OpenTelemetry monitoring. HackerOne program for security vulnerability reporting.

### **settings.md**
Comprehensive configuration documentation covering settings files hierarchy (user ~/.claude/settings.json, project .claude/settings.json and .claude/settings.local.json, enterprise managed-settings.json, managed-mcp.json). Available settings include apiKeyHelper (custom script for auth), cleanupPeriodDays (transcript retention), env (environment variables), includeCoAuthoredBy (git byline), permissions (allow/ask/deny/additionalDirectories/defaultMode/disableBypassPermissionsMode), hooks (custom commands), disableAllHooks, model (override default), statusLine (custom status), outputStyle (adjust system prompt), forceLoginMethod/forceLoginOrgUUID, MCP server settings (enableAllProjectMcpServers, enabledMcpjsonServers, disabledMcpjsonServers, useEnterpriseMcpConfigOnly), AWS settings (awsAuthRefresh, awsCredentialExport). Settings precedence from highest to lowest: Enterprise managed policies, Command line arguments, Local project settings, Shared project settings, User settings. Excluding sensitive files via permissions.deny. Subagent configuration stored in markdown files at user (~/.claude/agents/) or project (.claude/agents/) levels. Comprehensive environment variables table covering authentication, model configuration, AWS/Vertex settings, bash defaults, client certificates, telemetry, MCP, and regional overrides. Tools available to Claude listed with permission requirements. Extending tools with hooks.

### **setup.md**
System requirements: macOS 10.15+, Ubuntu 20.04+/Debian 10+, Windows 10+ (WSL 1/2 or Git for Windows), 4GB+ RAM, Node.js 18+, internet connection, Bash/Zsh/Fish shell, Anthropic supported countries. Standard installation via npm install (avoid sudo). Authentication options: Claude Console (default OAuth, active billing required, automatic Claude Code workspace creation for usage tracking), Claude App (Pro/Max subscription unifying Claude Code and web interface), Enterprise platforms (Bedrock/Vertex with cloud infrastructure). Windows setup supports WSL 1/2 or native Windows with Git Bash. Alternative installation methods: global npm (traditional), native binary installation (beta, macOS/Linux/WSL/Windows with install script), local installation (migrate-installer to ~/.claude/local/ avoiding autoupdater permission issues). Auto-updates with background downloads, notifications, next-start application. Disable via DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER or settings.json. Manual update via claude update command.

### **slash-commands.md**
Built-in slash commands for session management, configuration, debugging, and utilities: /add-dir, /agents, /bug (report bugs to Anthropic), /clear, /compact, /config, /cost, /doctor, /help, /init, /login, /logout, /mcp, /memory, /model, /permissions, /pr_comments, /review, /rewind, /status, /terminal-setup, /usage, /vim. Custom slash commands stored as Markdown files in .claude/commands/ (project, shows "(project)") or ~/.claude/commands/ (personal, shows "(user)"). Features include namespacing via subdirectories (affects description only), arguments via $ARGUMENTS (all arguments) or $1, $2, etc. (positional), bash command execution via ! prefix with allowed-tools specification, file references via @ prefix, and thinking mode via extended thinking keywords. Frontmatter supports allowed-tools, argument-hint, description, model, and disable-model-invocation fields. SlashCommand tool enables Claude to invoke custom slash commands programmatically.

### **statusline.md**
Custom status line configuration displaying at bottom of interface (similar to terminal prompts/PS1). Create via /statusline command (asks Claude Code to help setup, can reproduce terminal prompt or custom behavior) or directly add statusLine command to .claude/settings.json with type, command path, and optional padding. Status line updates when conversation messages update (max 300ms), uses first line of stdout, supports ANSI color codes, and receives contextual JSON via stdin (session_id, transcript_path, cwd, model display name, workspace current/project directories, version, output_style, cost total/duration/API duration/lines added/removed). Example scripts provided in Bash, Python, and Node.js for simple status lines, git-aware status lines, and parsing JSON input for displaying model, directory, and git branch.

### **sub-agents.md**
Specialized AI assistants with task-specific configurations, custom system prompts, separate context windows, and configurable tools. Benefits include context preservation (separate from main conversation), specialized expertise (domain-specific instructions), reusability (cross-project sharing), and flexible permissions (tool access levels per subagent). Quick start via /agents command to create project-level or user-level subagents. Configuration files stored as Markdown with YAML frontmatter in .claude/agents/ (project) or ~/.claude/agents/ (user). File format includes frontmatter (name, description, tools optional, model optional) and system prompt content. Model selection supports aliases (sonnet/opus/haiku), 'inherit' (use main conversation model), or omitted (default subagent model). Tools can be omitted (inherit all including MCP) or specified individually. Managing via /agents command (recommended for comprehensive interface with tool listing) or direct file management. CLI-based configuration via --agents flag with JSON object (lower priority than project, higher than user). Built-in subagents provided by Claude Code. Automatic invocation based on description or explicit request. MCP tools accessible to subagents when tools field omitted.

### **terminal-config.md**
Terminal appearance and configuration guidance. Themes handled by terminal application, matched via /config command. Custom status line for contextual information display. Line breaks via quick escape (\\+Enter), Shift+Enter setup (/terminal-setup for VS Code/iTerm2), or Option+Enter (Mac Terminal.app, iTerm2, VS Code with specific settings). Notification setup via iTerm 2 system notifications (Profiles → Terminal → Silence bell and Filter Alerts) or custom notification hooks. Handling large inputs via file-based workflows (avoid direct pasting, be aware of VS Code terminal truncation). Vim Mode via /vim or /config with supported subset (mode switching, navigation h/j/k/l, w/e/b, 0/$, gg/G, editing x, dw/de/db/dd/D, cw/ce/cb/cc/C, . repeat).

### **third-party-integrations.md**
Identical content to bedrock-vertex-proxies.md. Overview of deployment options comparing Anthropic, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Vertex AI across regions, prompt caching, authentication, cost tracking, and enterprise features. Configuration examples for using Bedrock/Vertex with corporate proxy or LLM Gateway. Choosing deployment based on organizational needs (direct provider access, corporate proxy, LLM Gateway). Debugging with /status slash command and ANTHROPIC_LOG=debug. Best practices: invest in CLAUDE.md documentation (organization-wide and repository-level), simplify deployment (one-click install), start with guided usage (codebase Q&A, small fixes, plan review), configure security policies (managed permissions), leverage MCP for integrations.

### **troubleshooting.md**
Common installation issues covering Windows WSL errors (OS/platform detection via npm config, Node not found from Windows vs WSL installation, nvm version conflicts via PATH priority/loading), Linux/Mac permission errors (recommended native installation or migrate-installer alternative). Permissions and authentication including repeated permission prompts (use /permissions) and authentication issues (logout/restart or remove auth.json). Performance and stability covering high CPU/memory (use /compact, restart, add build dirs to .gitignore), command hangs (Ctrl+C or terminal restart), search/discovery issues (install system ripgrep, set USE_BUILTIN_RIPGREP=0), slow/incomplete search on WSL (cross-filesystem performance penalties, solution: work in WSL filesystem or use WSL 2).

### **vs-code.md**
Identical content to ide-integrations.md. VS Code extension (beta) with native IDE experience, dedicated sidebar panel, plan mode, auto-accept edits, file management, MCP usage, conversation history, multiple sessions, keyboard shortcuts, and slash commands. Requirements VS Code 1.98.0+. Third-party provider support (Bedrock/Vertex) via environment variables. Not yet implemented: full MCP config, subagents config, checkpoints, advanced shortcuts (#, !), tab completion. Security considerations about IDE config file modification risks. Legacy CLI integration for selection context, diff viewing, file references, diagnostic sharing across VS Code/Cursor/Windsurf/VSCodium. Troubleshooting extension installation and legacy integration issues.
