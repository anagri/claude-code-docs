---

This page provides guidance on migrating from Claude 3.7 models to Claude 4 models \(e.g., Opus 4.1 and Sonnet 4.5\). In most cases, you can switch to Claude 4 models with minimal changes:

  1. Update your model name:
     * From: `claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219`
     * To: `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929` \(or `claude-opus-4-1-20250805`\)
  2. Existing API calls should continue to work without modification, although API behavior has changed slightly \(see [API release notes](/en/release-notes/api) for details\).

## What’s new in Claude 4

### New refusal stop reason

Claude 4 models introduce a new `refusal` stop reason for content that the model declines to generate for safety reasons, due to the increased intelligence of Claude 4 models:

Copy
[code]
    {"id":"msg_014XEDjypDjFzgKVWdFUXxZP",
    "type":"message",
    "role":"assistant",
    "model":"claude-sonnet-4-5",
    "content":[{"type":"text","text":"I would be happy to assist you. You can "}],
    "stop_reason":"refusal",
    "stop_sequence":null,
    "usage":{"input_tokens":564,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"output_tokens":22}
    }

[/code]

When migrating to Claude 4.x, you should update your application to [handle `refusal` stop reasons](/en/docs/test-and-evaluate/strengthen-guardrails/handle-streaming-refusals).

### Summarized thinking

With extended thinking enabled, the Messages API for Claude 4 models returns a summary of Claude’s full thinking process. Summarized thinking provides the full intelligence benefits of extended thinking, while preventing misuse. While the API is consistent across Claude 3.7 and 4 models, streaming responses for extended thinking might return in a “chunky” delivery pattern, with possible delays between streaming events.

Summarization is processed by a different model than the one you target in your requests. The thinking model does not see the summarized output.

For more information, see the [Extended thinking documentation](/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking#summarized-thinking).

### Interleaved thinking

Claude 4 models support interleaving tool use with extended thinking, allowing for more natural conversations where tool uses and responses can be mixed with regular messages.

Interleaved thinking is in beta. To enable interleaved thinking, add [the beta header](/en/api/beta-headers) `interleaved-thinking-2025-05-14` to your API request.

For more information, see the [Extended thinking documentation](/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking#interleaved-thinking).

### Behavioral differences

Claude 4 models, particularly Sonnet 4.5, have notable behavioral changes that may affect how you structure prompts:

#### Communication style changes

  * **More concise and direct** : Claude 4 models communicate more efficiently, with less verbose explanations
  * **More natural tone** : Responses are slightly more conversational and less machine-like
  * **Efficiency-focused** : May skip detailed summaries after completing actions to maintain workflow momentum \(you can prompt for more detail if needed\)

#### Instruction following

Claude 4 models are trained for precise instruction following and require more explicit direction:

  * **Be explicit about actions** : Use direct language like “Make these changes” or “Implement this feature” rather than “Can you suggest changes” if you want Claude to take action
  * **State desired behaviors clearly** : Claude will follow instructions precisely, so being specific about what you want helps achieve better results

For comprehensive guidance on working with these models, see [Claude 4 prompt engineering best practices](/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/claude-4-best-practices).

### Updated text editor tool

The text editor tool has been updated for Claude 4 models with the following changes:

  * **Tool type** : `text_editor_20250728`
  * **Tool name** : `str_replace_based_edit_tool`
  * The `undo_edit` command is no longer supported.

The `str_replace_editor` text editor tool remains the same for Claude Sonnet 3.7.

If you’re migrating from Claude Sonnet 3.7 and using the text editor tool:

Copy
[code]
    # Claude Sonnet 3.7
    tools=[
        {
            "type": "text_editor_20250124",
            "name": "str_replace_editor"
        }
    ]

    # Claude 4
    tools=[
        {
            "type": "text_editor_20250728",
            "name": "str_replace_based_edit_tool"
        }
    ]

[/code]

For more information, see the [Text editor tool documentation](/en/docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/text-editor-tool).

### Updated code execution tool

If you’re using the code execution tool, ensure you’re using the latest version `code_execution_20250825`, which adds Bash commands and file manipulation capabilities. The legacy version `code_execution_20250522` \(Python only\) is still available but not recommended for new implementations. For migration instructions, see the [Code execution tool documentation](/en/docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/code-execution-tool#upgrade-to-latest-tool-version).

## Removed features

### Token-efficient tool use no longer supported

[Token-efficient tool use](/en/docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/token-efficient-tool-use) is only available in Claude Sonnet 3.7. If you’re migrating from Claude Sonnet 3.7 and using token-efficient tool use, remove the `token-efficient-tools-2025-02-19` [beta header](/en/api/beta-headers) from your requests. The `token-efficient-tools-2025-02-19` beta header can still be included in Claude 4 requests, but it will have no effect.

### Extended output no longer supported

The `output-128k-2025-02-19` [beta header](/en/api/beta-headers) for extended output is only available in Claude Sonnet 3.7. If you’re migrating from Claude Sonnet 3.7, remove `output-128k-2025-02-19` from your requests. The `output-128k-2025-02-19` beta header can still be included in Claude 4 requests, but it will have no effect.

## Performance considerations

### Choose Claude Sonnet 4.5 for:

  * **Long-running agents** : Best-in-class for autonomous agents that work independently for extended periods
  * **Coding tasks** : Our strongest coding model with advanced planning and security engineering
  * **Large context workflows** : Enhanced context management with memory tool and context editing capabilities
  * **Most use cases** : Latest model with the best balance of capability and performance

### Choose Claude Opus 4.1 for:

  * **Specialized complex tasks** : When you need exceptional depth of analysis
  * **Tasks where speed is not critical** : Slower but more thorough than Sonnet models

### Extended thinking recommendations

Claude 4 models, particularly Sonnet 4.5, show significant performance improvements when using [extended thinking](/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking) for coding and complex reasoning tasks. Extended thinking is **disabled by default** but we recommend enabling it for demanding work. **Enabling extended thinking:**

  * **API** : Include the `thinking` parameter in your requests:

Copy
[code]response = client.messages.create(
            model="claude-sonnet-4-5",
            max_tokens=16000,
            thinking={
                "type": "enabled",
                "budget_tokens": 10000
            },
            messages=[...]
        )

[/code]

  * **Claude Code** : Set the `MAX_THINKING_TOKENS` environment variable in your [settings](/en/docs/claude-code/settings):

Copy
[code]{
          "env": {
            "MAX_THINKING_TOKENS": "10000"
          }
        }

[/code]

**Important** : Extended thinking impacts [prompt caching](/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-caching#caching-with-thinking-blocks) efficiency. When non-tool-result content is added to a conversation, thinking blocks are stripped from cache, which can increase costs in multi-turn conversations. We recommend enabling thinking when the performance benefits outweigh the caching trade-off.

## Migration checklist

  * Update model id in your API calls
  * Test existing requests \(should work without changes\)
  * Review [Claude 4 prompt engineering best practices](/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/claude-4-best-practices) to understand behavioral changes and prompt optimization
  * Update prompts to be more explicit about desired actions \(e.g., “Implement this” vs “Can you suggest”\)
  * Adjust expectations for communication style \(more concise, may need to prompt for detailed summaries if desired\)
  * Remove `token-efficient-tools-2025-02-19` beta header if applicable
  * Remove `output-128k-2025-02-19` beta header if applicable
  * Handle new `refusal` stop reason
  * Update text editor tool type and name if using it
  * Remove any code that uses the `undo_edit` command
  * If using code execution tool: Upgrade to latest version \(`code_execution_20250825`\) if still on legacy version
  * Explore new tool interleaving capabilities with extended thinking
  * If using Sonnet 4.5: Review [What’s new in Sonnet 4.5](/en/docs/about-claude/models/whats-new-sonnet-4-5) for additional features
  * If using Sonnet 4.5: Handle `model_context_window_exceeded` stop reason
  * If using Sonnet 4.5: Consider enabling memory tool for long-running agents \(beta\)
  * If using Sonnet 4.5: Consider using automatic tool call clearing for context editing \(beta\)
  * For agentic workflows: Leverage state tracking capabilities with structured state files \(JSON recommended for structured data\)
  * Test in development before production deployment
