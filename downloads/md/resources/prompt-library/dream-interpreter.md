User| I had a dream last night that I was walking through a dense forest. The trees were tall and dark, and I could hear strange whispers coming from the shadows. Suddenly, I stumbled upon a clearing where I found a majestic white stag standing in the center. As I approached the stag, it transformed into a wise old man who handed me a golden key. Then I woke up. What could this dream mean?

## Example output

Thank you for sharing your dream with me. Dreams often contain symbolic messages that can provide insights into our subconscious minds and emotional states. Let’s explore the potential meanings behind the symbols in your dream. The dense, dark forest might represent a period of uncertainty, confusion, or a feeling of being lost in your waking life. The whispers coming from the shadows could symbolize your subconscious fears or doubts that you may be struggling with. The clearing in the forest could signify a moment of clarity or enlightenment amid the darkness. The white stag is often seen as a symbol of spiritual guidance, purity, and transformation. Its presence in the clearing might suggest that you are seeking direction or wisdom in your life. The transformation of the stag into a wise old man could represent the wisdom and guidance you are searching for. The golden key he hands you might symbolize the tools, knowledge, or opportunities you need to unlock the next stage of your personal growth or journey. Overall, this dream could be interpreted as a message from your subconscious, urging you to trust in your own intuition and inner wisdom to navigate through a challenging period in your life. The dream may be encouraging you to seek guidance, embrace transformation, and unlock new possibilities for personal growth and enlightenment. However, it’s essential to remember that dream interpretation is highly personal, and the meaning of your dream may be influenced by your own life experiences, emotions, and current circumstances. Reflect on how the symbols and emotions in the dream relate to your waking life, and consider what personal message or insight the dream might be offering you. Do you feel that this interpretation resonates with you? Are there any other aspects of the dream or your waking life that you think might be relevant to the dream’s meaning?
