### Example output

>   * Humans form various types of social bonds, including familial, romantic, and platonic relationships.
>   * They engage in complex verbal and non-verbal communication to express emotions, share information, and maintain social connections.
>   * Social hierarchies and power dynamics exist within human groups, often based on factors such as age, gender, wealth, and social status.
>   * Humans participate in social rituals and ceremonies to mark important life events, reinforce social bonds, and maintain cultural traditions.
>
Hypotheses:

>   * The formation of social bonds and relationships may serve as an evolutionary adaptation to increase chances of survival and reproduction.
>   * Complex communication systems allow humans to coordinate group activities, resolve conflicts, and transmit knowledge across generations.
>   * Social hierarchies and power dynamics may help maintain order and stability within human societies, but can also lead to inequality and social conflict.
>   * Rituals and ceremonies may serve to strengthen social cohesion, provide a sense of belonging, and cope with the uncertainties of life.
